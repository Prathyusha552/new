                    <h1>Director's Desk</h1>
                    <p>It is always a delight to address children. They are our tomorrow - our future.
                        Bright faces of children with great potential that I see here today receiving prizes and
                        evincing their talents will be the citizens of tomorrow..</p>

                    <p>They may grow up tomorrow to ascend great heights in life, make huge breakthroughs, win hearts,
                        make a name for themselves or they might just turn out to be a burden on the society,
                        stragglers in the race of life, waiting for someone to give them a job.
                        What they turn out to be in the future is what we make of them today.I have had several
                        instances where parents are so concerned about the future of the child that they actually forget
                        the main purpose of education in the process of making them compete in the rat race. As the old
                        adage goes “Give a man a ﬁsh you will feed him for a day; teach a man how to ﬁsh and you feed
                        him for a lifetime”.</p>

                    <p>Sanskriti Schools have always been about inspiring students. Throughout the year the staff puts
                        constant efforts towards quality education in every aspect.
                        We set our own standards and goals and strive to achieve them — be it in the area of academics,
                        sports, events, discipline, leadership, management systems and more.
                        Today I would like to talk about inspiration. A few months earlier, I had the opportunity to
                        interact with Mr Edward Rogers, a scientist at NASA. He asked me:
                    </P>
                    <p>“Vikranth, do you think that India needs to spend so much money to send an orbiter craft to mars
                        and eventually maybe ﬁnd water when people are dying without water down here?”
                        His words kept ringing in my ear for some time. But later I had the answer. These things are
                        necessary because they inspire us to dream big, to aim for the stars and to leave our comfort
                        zone. Things like a world cup win in cricket, Rakesh Sharma's travel to space, test ﬁring of an
                        Agni missile all serve as an inspiration. Likewise, we have to concentrate on inspiring
                        children. Look at it this way, if you look too closely in the mirror, you can't really see
                        yourself—it's just a blur. But when you get farther away, you actually see yourself more
                        clearly.
                    </p>

                    <p>Sometimes we're just so close, so enmeshed, that we just can‘t see them as an individual. But if
                        you step back, you start to see your children as individuals with their own distinctive features
                        and then you'll be able to help them understand themselves as well. It is only when you take a
                        step back and observe that you‘ll know what works for them,
                        why they reach for certain things and what really gets them to move towards certain things.</p>

                    <p>There will be things that they may not have the slightest motivation to undergo but have to do
                        so. They may hate doing their chores and try to find a way out of it and that's when you parents
                        play a major role. The goal is to get them to do what they dislike and get to know them well
                        enough to ﬁgure out where their interests lie. As a parent, you should help them identify their
                        strengths and work towards helping them reach their goals. </p>

                    <p>Our responsibility is to help our kids wade through challenges, not fight it for them. We need to
                        stay out of their way long enough for them to ﬁgure out who they are, their thought process and
                        what interests them. The talents they demonstrate here are proof that they have the potential to
                        be useful citizens of the future.</p>

                        Dear Parents,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Greetings,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is with immense pleasure and a profound sense of responsibility that I extend my warmest
                        welcome to each of you as the Principal of Sanskriti Kids. I with deep honour and dedication
                        embark on this journey to collaborate with you in fostering an environment of academic
                        excellence, holistic development, and unwavering commitment to our collective mission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the heart of our Sanskriti Kids lies a steadfast dedication to nurturing not only the
                        intellectual capacities of our students but also their emotional intelligence, social
                        consciousness, and moral integrity. Together, we will strive to cultivate a learning community
                        where curiosity is celebrated, diversity is embraced, and each individual is empowered to
                        realize their full potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As partners in this noble pursuit of academic excellence, I invite you to join hands with us in
                        fostering a culture of collaboration, open communication, and mutual respect. Your insights,
                        feedback, and active participation are invaluable in shaping the future trajectory of our school
                        and ensuring the holistic development of every child entrusted to our care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to express my sincere gratitude for the warm welcome I have received from the management
                        and the staff. I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as your principal and look forward to
